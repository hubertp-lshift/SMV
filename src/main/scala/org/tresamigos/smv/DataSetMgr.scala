/**
 * DataSetMgr (DSM) is the entrypoint for SmvApp to load the SmvDataSets in a project.
 * Every DSM method to load SmvDataSets creates a new transaction within which
 * all of the indicated SmvDataSets are loaded from the most recent source and
 * resolved. All SmvDataSets provided by DSM are resolved. DSM delegates to
 * DataSetRepo to discover SmvDataSets to DataSetResolver to load and resolve
 * SmvDataSets. DSM methods like load which look up SmvDataSets by name accept an
 * arbitrary number of names so that all the target SmvDataSets
 * are loaded within the same transaction (which is much faster).
